First Project of the Odin Project using HTML.

Created three separate web pages and linked them to the home page. The links are created as list items in an unordered list.

Added an image to each sub webpage and use "h1" and "h3" tags for headings.

Used "p" tags for the description.

Used an unordered list and an ordered list to list out ingredients and the steps.
